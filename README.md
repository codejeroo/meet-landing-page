### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex box
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to use translateX property as well as building a hero section where images overflow. It was a challenge and honestly I enjoyed every bit of it. It was a hard starting out in mobile first workflow but I scaled it pretty well using queries. Would've been nice to use em and rem and clamp but this is just a fast spaced solution. I'll update it later on.

### Continued development

I will this as an opportunity to further master CSS Grid and be able to finish task much more faster.
